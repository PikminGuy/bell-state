# QOSF Mentorship Programme Screening - Task 2

Hey! I'm Harvey and this is my submission for **task 2** of the screening process. 
The relevant notebook for my solution is **qosf_task2.ipynb**. 

Note that if you run the notebook locally, you need to first save your IBMQ token to your local system in order to use the noise model from the IBMQ Valencia backend.

Thank you very much for this opportunity!
